## About Me üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I‚Äôm a Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) student at **SRM University, Kattankulathur**, pursuing a specialization in **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning** (AIML). I'll be graduating with B.Tech degree in 2028.

I enjoy programming, exploring the latest technology, building projects, and solving real-world problems through code. I‚Äôm also fascinated by theoretical physics, with a particular interest in the strange and mind-bending world of quantum physics üß†. I'm a cricket enthusiast and have a special place in my heart for Test cricket üèè. In my downtime, I unwind with sitcoms like Friends (my favorite!) and enjoy gripping US crime/drama series. I'm also a big fan of GoT! üé¨
